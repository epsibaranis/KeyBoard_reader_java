Air Pollution along the Yangtze
This densely wooded hillside along the banks of the Yangtze River, China, is shrouded by air pollution. 
Rapidly developing countries like China must often deal with air pollution as new factories emit substances such as smoke and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Air pollution consists of chemicals or particles in the air that can harm the health of humans, animals, and plants.
It also damages buildings. Pollutants in the air take many forms. They can be gases, solid particles, or liquid droplets
Sources of Air Pollution
Pollution enters the Earth's atmosphere in many different ways. 
Most air pollution is created by people, taking the form of emissions from factories, cars, planes, or aerosol cans. 
Second-hand cigarette smoke is also considered air pollution. These man-made sources of pollution are called anthropogenic sources.
Some types of air pollution, such as smoke from wildfires or ash from volcanoes, occur naturally. These are called natural sources.
Air pollution is most common in large cities where emissions from many different sources are concentrated. Sometimes, 
mountains or tall buildings prevent air pollution from spreading out. 
This air pollution often appears as a cloud making the air murky. It is called smog. The word "smog" comes from combining the words "smoke" and "fog."
Large cities in poor and developing nations tend to have more air pollution than cities in developed nations. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), some of the worlds most polluted cities are Karachi, Pakistan;
 New Delhi, India; Beijing, China; Lima, Peru; and Cairo, Egypt. However, many developed nations also have air pollution problems. 
Los Angeles, California, is nicknamed Smog City.
